Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 75% of lung cancers and adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype. Although cigarette-smoking is the main cause of lung cancer, more than a third afflicted in Singapore are never-smokers and 69% affect females. For the majority who present with advanced NSCLC, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Despite advances made with newer chemotherapeutic agents, it is apparent that the benefit of conventional chemotherapy has plateaued. Efforts toward developing novel treatments based on growing understanding of molecular oncology have yielded drugs that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). They have expanded treatment options for patients with advanced NSCLC. However, monoclonal antibody to VEGF is contraindicated in patients with squamous cell carcinoma due to increased incidence of fatal hemoptysis. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) appear promising but only 40% of east-asian female never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma harbour EGFR gene mutations. Estrogen, KRAS, BRAF, ERBE and other genetic mutations can confound response. Molecular data obtained from Caucasian and predominantly east-asian population may not apply to our multi-ethnic groups and our aim is to determine the molecular characteristics of our multi-ethnic asian phenotypes to better understand the process of carcinogenesis and treatment response as well as identify potential novel targets for future drug development. Paraffin-embedded tissues are recalled, and DNA is extracted for mutational analysis, which will be correlated to patient demographics, treatment and outcome.",Inclusion Criteria: * Asian ethnicity * Age \> 21 years old * Non-smoker * Metastatic pleural effusion due to lung adenocarcinoma * Good ECOG status (ECOG 1-2) fit to undergo pleuroscopy and biopsy and agreeable for palliative chemotherapy and or EGFR-TKI Exclusion Criteria: * Non-Asian ethnicity * Age \< 21 years old * Smoker * Subjects with poor ECOG status or unwilling to undergo pleuroscopy and biopsy * Subjects not suitable to receive palliative chemotherapy or EGFR-TKI * All other histological subtypes and stages of disease,Descriptive study of our patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

NCT02606149,Truthful Information on Chemotherapy and Its Impact on Chemotherapy at the End of Life,Impact of a Truthful Information Concerning Chemotherapy on Chemotherapy Prescription at the End of Life : a Randomized Controlled Study in Non-curable Lung Cancer Patients,COMPLETED,2016-07-15,2020-10-15,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,123,Stage IV Lung Cancer,ALL,18 Years,,Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,"Patients with metastatic cancer have a substantial symptom burden and may receive aggressive care at the end of life. There is evidence that the use of chemotherapy near the end of life is not related to its likelihood of providing benefit and the overuse of aggressive anticancer therapies near the end of life may result in more toxicity than clinical benefit. Moreover, proposing new lines of treatment after successive therapeutic failures may be a way of avoiding discussion of prognosis and advance care planning. It has been proposed that systems not providing overly aggressive care near the end of life would be the ones in which less than 10% of patients receive chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life. Presently the first consultation between patient and oncologist is ruled in France by the first ""Plan Cancer"" and the ""Dispositif d'annonce"" (announcement planning). Oncologists are supposed to explain the diagnosis of cancer and to present a treatment plan. In routine practice for metastatic non curable cancer patients, chemotherapy is presented as the leading therapy and its side effects are explained. The use of chemotherapy has been associated with the worsening of two major competitive life-threatening conditions for cancer patients: cachexia and thrombo-embolic events. Nevertheless the risk of worsening both those conditions is hardly explained in routine practice. This study proposes to examine in a monocentric interventional prospective randomized trial, the impact of a particular way for the oncologist to present chemotherapy at the diagnosis stage on the easiness of timely chemotherapy interruption at the end of life. The main objective is to determine whether or not the explanation of the potential role of anticancer chemotherapy in worsening life-threatening conditions impacts the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life compared with usual presentation. Secondary objectives are to determine the impact of this communication strategy on overall survival and other indicators of aggressiveness of care and palliative care resources use. The hypothesis is that the intervention will allow 15% of patients receiving anticancer therapy during the last 30 days of life, as compared to 30% in the control group. The investigators expect that the intervention evaluated in this study will reduce the rate of patients receiving chemotherapy during the last 30 days of life hopefully improving the quality of end of life care. A secondary objective is overall survival and this study will therefore verify that the intervention arm is not associated with poorer overall survival. But more probably investigators expect patients in the intervention arm to have an improved overall survival mainly link to a decrease in harms due to chemotherapy given near the end of life and to better palliative care. In effect the hypothesis is that showing the life-threatening risks associated with chemotherapy and thus reducing for patients the importance of this treatment will leave room for improved palliative care as shown notably by earlier and more frequent referral to palliative care specialists. If this trial is positive, it will prove the capital role of patient-doctor communication in cancer care and that few differences in communication strategy could improve end of life care and maybe even survival. The impact on the oncology community would be major since the intervention could be easily transposed in all practices at no additional cost. It would also emphasize the importance of communication skills and human relationship in the very technical field of medical oncology.","Inclusion Criteria: * stage IV lung cancer, histologically proven * \> 18 years old * diagnosed during the last 8 weeks * systemic therapy indicated Exclusion Criteria: * prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease * comorbidity not compatible with the inclusion according to the investigator * patient has not given its non-objection or not being able to give * patient unaffiliated or not beneficiary of a social security scheme",Number of patients receiving chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life,"Patient knowledge of the goals of care assessed by questionnaire | Patient knowledge of the goals of care assessed by questionnaire | Number of survivals | Number of appeals to palliative care | Number of onco-palliative meetings | Number of use of emergency room, intensive care unit and hospice service in the last month of life | Number of unscheduled hospitalizations | Number of chemotherapy cycles received | Number of days spent in acute care | Number of days spent in conventional oncology hospital | Place of death",BEHAVIORAL:Truthful information on chemotherapy risks | BEHAVIORAL:Standard of information,432,"{'trial_id': None, 'trial_category': 'therapeutic_interventional', 'age': {'min': 18, 'max': None}, 'region_specific_age': {'japan_min': None}, 'inclusion': {'disease': {'confirmed_by': 'histology', 'cancer_type': 'lung cancer', 'histology_subtype': '', 'stage': 'IV', 'stage_list': ['IV'], 'metastatic': True, 'measurable_disease_recist': None, 'biomarker_required': []}, 'performance_status': {'scale': 'ECOG', 'min': None, 'max': None}, 'life_expectancy_weeks': None, 'prior_therapy': {'required': [], 'allowed': [], 'disallowed': ['systemic therapy for metastatic disease'], 'max_lines_systemic': 0, 'washout_weeks': {'chemotherapy': None, 'targeted_therapy': None, 'immunotherapy': None, 'investigational': None, 'radiation': None, 'major_surgery': None}}, 'brain_metastases': None, 'brain_mets_stable_duration_weeks': None, 'organ_function': {'anc': None, 'platelets': None, 'hemoglobin_g_per_dl': None, 'creatinine_clearance_ml_min': None, 'bilirubin_x_uln': None, 'ast_alt_x_uln': None, 'albumin_g_per_dl': None}, 'cardiac': {'qtcf_ms_max': None, 'recent_mi_months_exclusion': None, 'nyha_class_max': None, 'lvef_percent_min': None}, 'contraception_required': None, 'other_inclusions': ['diagnosed during the last 8 weeks']}, 'exclusion': {'pregnant_or_breastfeeding': None, 'active_cns_metastases': None, 'uncontrolled_intercurrent_illness': True, 'grade_2_or_higher_neuropathy': None, 'history_of': [], 'concurrent_medications_disallowed': [], 'other_exclusions': ['patient unaffiliated or not beneficiary of a social security scheme', 'patient has not given non-objection']}}"

Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not approved the drug for this type of cancer, or for any use outside of research studies. When cancer spreads from the primary tumor, one of the most commons sites it spreads to is bone. When cancer spreads to bone there can be significant symptoms such as pain. Cabozantinib works by blocking signaling that leads to cancer growth as well as blocking the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that help to feed a tumor. Cabozantinib has been studied or is being studied in research studies as a possible treatment for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, brain cancer, thyroid cancer, lung cancer and kidney cancer. Previous clinical research studies indicate that cabozantinib may also have activity against cancer once it has spread to the bones. The purpose of this study is to find out if cabozantinib is effective in treating cancer that has spread to the bone.","Inclusion Criteria: * Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of a solid tumor (not breast or prostate) that is metastatic and refractory to or progressed following standard therapies * Has bony metastases * Agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception Exclusion Criteria: * Pregnant or breastfeeding * Received cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy) or biologic agents within 3 weeks of study entry(6 weeks for nitrosoureas/mitomycin C) * Received radiation to the thoracic cavity/GI tract (within 3 months of study entry), to bone or brain metastasis (within 14 days) or to any other site within 28 days * Received prior treatment with small molecule kinase inhibitor or hormonal therapy within 14 days/5 half-lives * Received therapy with another investigational agent within past 28 days * Has not recovered from toxicities due to prior therapies * Primary brain tumor * Active brain metastases or epidural disease * Uncontrolled significant intercurrent or recent illness * Allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulation",Number of Participants With Bone Bio-marker Response,Number of Patients With Skeletal-related Events (SRE) | Quality of Life as Assessed by FACT-G | Overall Tumor Response Rate | MET Amplification in Tumor Sample | Response to Cabozantinib in Bone Metastatic Disease | Time to SRE,DRUG:Cabozantinib,1096,"{'trial_id': None, 'trial_category': 'therapeutic_interventional', 'age': {'min': 18, 'max': None}, 'region_specific_age': {'japan_min': None}, 'inclusion': {'disease': {'confirmed_by': 'histologic or cytologic', 'cancer_type': 'solid tumor', 'histology_subtype': '', 'stage': 'metastatic', 'stage_list': [], 'metastatic': True, 'measurable_disease_recist': None, 'biomarker_required': []}, 'performance_status': {'scale': 'ECOG', 'min': None, 'max': None}, 'life_expectancy_weeks': None, 'prior_therapy': {'required': ['refractory to or progressed following standard therapies'], 'allowed': [], 'disallowed': [], 'max_lines_systemic': None, 'washout_weeks': {'chemotherapy': 3, 'targeted_therapy': 2, 'immunotherapy': None, 'investigational': 4, 'radiation': 3, 'major_surgery': None}}, 'brain_metastases': 'allowed_if_treated_and_stable', 'brain_mets_stable_duration_weeks': None, 'organ_function': {'anc': None, 'platelets': None, 'hemoglobin_g_per_dl': None, 'creatinine_clearance_ml_min': None, 'bilirubin_x_uln': None, 'ast_alt_x_uln': None, 'albumin_g_per_dl': None}, 'cardiac': {'qtcf_ms_max': None, 'recent_mi_months_exclusion': None, 'nyha_class_max': None, 'lvef_percent_min': None}, 'contraception_required': True, 'other_inclusions': ['Bony metastases']}, 'exclusion': {'pregnant_or_breastfeeding': True, 'active_cns_metastases': True, 'uncontrolled_intercurrent_illness': True, 'grade_2_or_higher_neuropathy': None, 'history_of': [], 'concurrent_medications_disallowed': [], 'other_exclusions': ['Primary brain tumor', 'Allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulation', 'Not recovered from toxicities due to prior therapies']}}"
